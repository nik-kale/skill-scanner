A best-effort security scanner for AI Agent Skills that detects prompt injection, data exfiltration, and malicious code patterns. Combines **pattern-based detection** (YAML + YARA), **LLM-as-a-judge**, and **behavioral dataflow analysis** to maximize detection coverage of probable threats while minimizing false positives.

> **Important:** This scanner provides best-effort detection, not comprehensive or complete coverage. A scan that returns no findings does not guarantee that a skill is free of all threats. See [Scope and Limitations](#scope-and-limitations) below.

Supports [OpenAI Codex Skills](https://openai.github.io/codex/) and [Cursor Agent Skills](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) formats following the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io).

## Highlights

- **Multi-Engine Detection** - Static analysis, behavioral dataflow, LLM semantic analysis, and cloud-based scanning for layered, best-effort coverage
- **False Positive Filtering** - Meta-analyzer significantly reduces noise while preserving detection capability
- **CI/CD Ready** - SARIF output for GitHub Code Scanning, exit codes for build failures
- **Extensible** - Plugin architecture for custom analyzers

## Scope and Limitations

> [!WARNING]
> Skill Scanner is a **best-effort** detection tool -- not a guarantee of safety. Like antivirus software, no scanner can catch every possible threat: the input space for adversarial AI agent skills is unbounded and continuously evolving.
>
> **What this means in practice:**
>
> - **No findings ≠ no risk.** A scan that returns zero results means the scanner did not detect any known threat patterns. It does not certify that a skill is safe, benign, or free of all vulnerabilities. The scan output uses neutral language like "No findings" rather than "safe" or "clean" to reflect this.
> - **Detection is not comprehensive.** The scanner uses multiple engines (regex/YARA signatures, LLM semantic analysis, behavioral dataflow, and optional cloud services), custom rule packs, and configurable scan policies. These layers maximize coverage of probable attack patterns, but they cannot cover every conceivable technique -- especially novel or zero-day attacks.
> - **False positives and false negatives are expected.** The meta-analyzer and consensus modes reduce noise, but no configuration eliminates all false positives or catches all true positives. Tune the [scan policy](docs/scan-policy.md) to your risk tolerance.
> - **Human review is still essential.** Automated scanning is one layer of a defense-in-depth strategy. Critical deployments should pair scanner results with manual code review and threat modeling.
>
> We are transparent about these boundaries because security tools that overstate their coverage create a false sense of safety. The goal is to give you the best available signal, not a rubber stamp.

## Quick Start

### Environment Setup (Optional)

```bash
# For LLM analyzer and Meta-analyzer
export SKILL_SCANNER_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export SKILL_SCANNER_LLM_MODEL="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"

# For VirusTotal binary scanning
export VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY="your_virustotal_api_key"

# For Cisco AI Defense
export AI_DEFENSE_API_KEY="your_aidefense_api_key"
```

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Scan a single skill (core analyzers: static + bytecode + pipeline)
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill

# Scan with behavioral analyzer (dataflow analysis)
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-behavioral

# Scan with all engines
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-behavioral --use-llm --use-aidefense

# Scan with meta-analyzer for false positive filtering
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-llm --enable-meta

# Scan with trigger analyzer for vague description checks
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-trigger

# Run LLM analyzer multiple times and keep majority-agreed findings
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-llm --llm-consensus-runs 3

# Scan multiple skills recursively
skill-scanner scan-all /path/to/skills --recursive --use-behavioral

# Scan multiple skills with cross-skill overlap detection
skill-scanner scan-all /path/to/skills --recursive --check-overlap

# CI/CD: Fail build if threats found
skill-scanner scan-all ./skills --fail-on-findings --format sarif --output results.sarif

# Generate interactive HTML report with attack correlation groups
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-llm --enable-meta --format html --output report.html

# Use custom YARA rules
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --custom-rules /path/to/my-rules/

# Use custom taxonomy + threat mapping profiles (JSON/YAML)
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --taxonomy /path/to/taxonomy.json --threat-mapping /path/to/threat_mapping.json

# VirusTotal hash scan with optional unknown-file uploads
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-virustotal --vt-upload-files

# Use a scan policy preset (strict, balanced, permissive)
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --policy strict

# Use a custom org policy file
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --policy my_org_policy.yaml

# Generate a policy file to customise
skill-scanner generate-policy -o my_org_policy.yaml

# Interactive policy configurator (TUI)
skill-scanner configure-policy
```

**LLM provider note:** `--llm-provider` currently accepts `anthropic` or `openai`.
For Bedrock, Vertex, Azure, Gemini, and other LiteLLM backends, set provider-specific model strings and environment variables (see `docs/llm-analyzer.md`).

### Python SDK

```python
from skill_scanner import SkillScanner
from skill_scanner.core.analyzers import BehavioralAnalyzer

# Create scanner with analyzers
scanner = SkillScanner(analyzers=[
    BehavioralAnalyzer(),
])

# Scan a skill
result = scanner.scan_skill("/path/to/skill")

print(f"Findings: {len(result.findings)}")
print(f"Max severity: {result.max_severity}")

# Note: is_safe indicates no HIGH/CRITICAL findings were detected.
# It does not guarantee the skill is free of all risk.
if not result.is_safe:
    print("Issues detected -- review findings before deployment")
```
