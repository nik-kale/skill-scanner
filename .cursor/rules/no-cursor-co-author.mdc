# No Cursor Co-Author in Commits

When creating git commits, NEVER add a `Co-authored-by` trailer for Cursor, Cursor Agent, or any AI assistant.

Commits must only attribute human authors. Do not append lines like:

```
Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursor@cursor.com>
Co-authored-by: cursor[bot] <...>
```

Keep commit messages clean with only the summary and description. No AI attribution trailers.
