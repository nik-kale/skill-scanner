# API Server Rationale

## Context

Skill Scanner primarily analyzes local skill packages. Because the core scan target is local files, the CLI and Python SDK cover most development and authoring workflows.

## Why an API Exists

The API server is an optional integration layer, not a requirement for scanning.

It provides:

- HTTP-native integration for CI/CD systems
- upload-based workflows for web applications
- asynchronous batch processing and result polling
- service-to-service integration in distributed architectures

## When to Use Which Interface

### Prefer CLI/SDK

- local development
- one-off scans
- scripted scans in the same runtime environment

### Prefer API

- external systems that already integrate via REST
- web upload/review portals
- queued or remote orchestration workflows

## Practical Recommendation

Keep the API server available and documented as an optional interface.

- Position CLI as the default user path
- Position API as integration infrastructure
- Avoid describing the API as a remote skill access mechanism

See:

- `docs/api-server.md` for endpoint usage
- `docs/remote-skills-analysis.md` for local-vs-remote model details
